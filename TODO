- Show favicon.ico as first result
- Implement fetch with different user agent. Some favicons, especially those in PNG format may be optimized by CDNs etc,
  fetching with curl agent may yeld original file hash. It is unclear how Shodan crawls the icons so perhaps both versions need to be displayed.
